        <h2>How to Play Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe! Can you outwit your opponent and claim victory in this age-old battle of Xs and Os? Here's how it works:</p>

        <h3>Game Setup:</h3>
        <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
        <p>Players take turns to make a move. Each move consists of placing your symbol (X or O) in an empty square on the grid. The objective is to form a line of three of your symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>

        <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
        <p>Here are the basic rules to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A player wins if they are the first to create a line of three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.</li>
            <li>If all the squares on the grid are filled, and no player has won, the game is a draw.</li>
            <li>Players take turns, and each player can only place their own symbol on an empty square.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scoring:</h3>
        <p>Scoring is simple: you win the game by getting three of your symbols in a row. There are no points for style or flair; it's all about strategy and placement.</p>

        <h3>Game Etiquette:</h3>
        <p>Remember to be a good sport. Congratulate your opponent on a well-played game, and don't gloat if you win. It's all in the spirit of fun and competition!</p>
